# LIV_32_spectral_lag
This package are consists of 32 folders, which are named with the burst number

Each folder have four files:(i)1th-marg.jpg for the posterior corner plot in linear case (ii) 1th-post_equal_weights.dat for the posterior data points in linear case (iii)2th-marg.jpg for the posterior corner plot in quadratic case (iv)2th-post_equal_weights.dat for the posterior data points in quadratic case.

In the  *.datfile,  five colomns  correspond to $log_EQG$,$\zeta$,$E_b$,$\alpha_1$,$\mu$,$alpha_2$ and weights respectively.
